		<h4>Start	3.8.2024</h4>
		<p>Under here is my average typing speed. I know that it looks slow, but I have hugely improved during the last month. <br>
		I've learned to touch type.
		And now I'm trying to gain some more speed by keeping my accuracity as high as possible.<br>
		At the moment of writing this my current speed is: 34wpm. </p>

		<h4>Goal achieved	6.8.2024</h4>
		<p>It's now tuesdays 6.8.2024. Three days from the previous text. I've now achieved my
			goal for the summerbreak: 40WPM average speed! <br> I'm still not stable at 40wpm and I still
			have to improve my typing speed hugely. <br> My next goal is 50wpm, but in the long run I would like to achieve something like 80wpm.

		<h4>10fastfingers	6.8.2024</h4> 
		<p>Before I started seriosly learning touch typing, the only test I remember doing was the 10fastfingers finnish test. <br> 
		This test has no numbers or punctuation like monkeytype or typeracer. That's why when I now tried to do the same test again I got a score of 48wpm. <br> 
		I was actually shocked because I had forgot, that I was typing with punctuation and numbers. I'm very slow in typing numbers and thats the next thing to improve. <br> 
		Still my score on 10fastfingers was at least 15wpm faster that the last time I did the test maybe a week ago. <br> I have intensively trained everyday for this. And I will continue! <br>
		By clicking the image below, you can try completing the same test. Can you win me? </p>
